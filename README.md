## Usage

```sbt
// available for Scala 2.11 and 2.12
libraryDependencies += "com.github.hirofumi" %% "xgboost4j" % "0.7.2-p1"

// available for Scala 2.11
libraryDependencies += "com.github.hirofumi" %% "xgboost4j-flink" % "0.7.2-p1"
libraryDependencies += "com.github.hirofumi" %% "xgboost4j-spark" % "0.7.2-p1"
```

### Note

* You should use the above libraries with `LC_NUMERIC=C` (which is not overridden by `LC_ALL`) on macOS.
  Otherwise multi-threading may cause a segmentation fault.
* This library contains some GCC runtime libraries and I think GCC Runtime Library Exception can be applied.
  But I am not a lawyer.

* `g++-7` (installed by Homebrew, i.e. `brew install gcc@7`)
